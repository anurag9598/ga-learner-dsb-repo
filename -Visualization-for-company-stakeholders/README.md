### Project Overview

 
You have been hired by the stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights into the company's operations. Using the data visualization techniques you learned, you have to help visualize the data and see if you can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual `plots.`

Bar plotting
Scatter plotting
Kernel Density plotting
Subplot operations
Axes modifications


### Challenges faced

 The project had many challenges but the most challenging part was plotting the subplots for the  stakeholders yet it was due to my silly mistake that it took some time but overall it was a simple and easy project for beginners to do..


### Additional pointers

 Visualization not only help us to understand more but also the people who do not know any coding so it's required to show our data in the form of bar, scatter, etc.
