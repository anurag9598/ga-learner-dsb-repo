### Project Overview

 The project is based on NumPy and uses dataset for creating census and find the appropriate solution for questions arising in case of the dataset which has 7 features(columns) in it.
  


### Learnings from the project

 My Learning curve enhanced and now  I am comfortable with NumPy arrays and various functions present in it.
Numpy is also called numerical python because it is rich in functions to endorse  numerical aspects and arrays in it is faster and convenient than list
 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 So, first of all, I created a census array which had basic data that was further used to find various solutions like higher  education leads to more earning or not,
find Senior Welfare, Minority report so the government can help them, and tell how old the country is...


### Challenges faced

 There were various challenges to do it but the most challenging was a minority report, getting an appropriate report by distributing census data into the race and doing further calculations took a lot of conceptual knowledge to solve it.


### Additional pointers

 Overall it was a nice beginning for me to do manipulation using Numpy
